AI & AUTOMATION SPECIALIST
Hands-on automation builder with 5+ years in process engineering and data integration, including 3 years intensely focused on AI/automation delivery. I design and build workflows that remove operational friction mapping processes, writing PRDs, building n8n/Power Automate orchestrations, integrating APIs, implementing AI agents, and driving adoption through training and documentation. Recently eliminated 129+ hours/week of manual work (~$470K annualized) and reduced operational load by ~4.5 FTE through scalable automation across enterprise systems. Strong technical foundation in workflow orchestration, API integration, SQL, AI/LLM implementation, and secure automation design.
